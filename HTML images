The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag
creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag

The <img> tag has two required attributes

Src - specifies the path to the image
Alt - specifies an alternate text for the image

<img src = “url” alt = “alternate text”>

The src attribute

The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image

Note when a web page loads, the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefor,
make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your
visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser
cannot find the image

The alt attribute

The required alt attribute provides an alternative text for an image, if the user for some reason
cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen
reader)

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:
<img src = “img_chania.jpg” alt = “Flowers in Chania”>

If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute
<img src = “wrong name.gif” alt = “Flowers in Chania”

Image size - width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image
<img src = “img_girl.jpg” alt = “Girl in a jacket” style = “width:500px;height: 600px;”>

Alternatively you can use the width and height attributes
<img src = “img_girl.jpg” alt = “Girl in a jacket” width = “500” height = “600”>

The width and height attributes always define the width and height of the image in pixels

We surgest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images

Images in another folder
If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute

<img src = “/images/html5.gif” alt = “HTML5 icon” style = “width:128px; height:128px;”>

Images on another server/website

Some web sites point to an image on another server

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute

<img src = “https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg” alt = “w3schools.com”>

Animated images
HTML allows animated GIFS
<img src = “programming.gif” alt = “Computer Man” style = “width:48px; height: 48px;”>

Images as a link
To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag
<a href = “default.asp”>
<img src = “smiley.gif” alt = “HTML tutorial” style = “width:42px;height:42px;”>
</a>

Image floating
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text

<p> img src = “smiley.gif” alt = “smiley face” style = “float:right;width:42px; height: 42px”> the
image will float to the right of the text. </p>
