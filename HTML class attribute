The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element
Multiple HTML elements can share the same class
Using the class attribute
The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a
JavaScript to access and manipulate elemnts with he specific classs name

This example we have <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of “city” . All of the three
<div> elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
Background-color: tomato;
Color: white;
Border: 2px solid black;
Margin: 20px;
Padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<div class = “city”>
<h2> London </h2>
<p> London is the capital of England </p>
</div>
</body>
</html>

In the following example we have two <span> elements with a class attribute with the value of
“note”. Both <span> elements will be styled equally according to the .note style defintion in the
head section

The class attribute can be used on any HTML element
Note: the class name is case sensitive
Tip: you can learn much more about CSS in our CSS tutorial

The syntax for class
To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. Then, define the CSS
properties within curly braces { } :

Multiple classes
HTML elements can belong to more than one class
To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class - “city main”> the
element will be styled according to all the classes specified

Different Elements can share same class
Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.
In the follwoing example, both <h2> and <p> points to the “city” class and will share the same style

Use of the class attribute in JavaScript
The class name can also be used by JavaScript to perform certain tasks for specific elements
JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName( )
method
So basically we program class structures, and fill them with CSS properties and in JavaScript we
can completely access elemnts with these methods

• The HTML class attribute specifies one or more class names for an element
• Classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elemnts
• The class attribute can be used on any HTML element
• The class name is case sensitive
• Different HTML elements can poin to the same class name
• JavaScript can access elements with a specific class name with the getElementsByClassName ( )
method
