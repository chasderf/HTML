The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type
For HTML 5, the declaration must have <!DOCTYPE html>

HTML headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags
<h1> defines the most important heading;; <h6> is the least important heading

HTML paragraphs

HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag::

HTML links
HTML links are defined with the <a> tag

<a href = “https://www.w3schools.com”>This is a link</a>

The links destination is specified in the href attributes
Attributes are used to provide additional information about html elements

HTML images
HTML images are defined with the <img> tag
The source file (src ), alternative text ( alt ), width, and height are provided as attributes

<img src=“w3schools.jpg” alt = “W3schools.com” width = “184” height=“142”>

To end the line and go into the next line <br>
This does not require a closing tag

<h1> “yellow world” <br> “how are we today” </h1>

The HREF attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to

<a href = “https://www.w3schools.com”> Visit W3schools </a>

The SRC attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to
the image to be displayed:
<img src = “img_girl.jpg”>

So the SRC specifies the path for the image

The width and height attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes which specifies the width and
height of the image
<img src = “img_girl.jpg” width = “500” height = “600” >

The alt Attribute
The requires alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternative text for an image, if the image for
some reason canot be displayed. This can due to slow connection or an error in the src attribute, or
if the user uses a screen reader
<img src = “img)girl.jpg” alt = “Girl With a jacket”>

The style attribute
The STYLE attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more

<p style = “color:red;”>this is a red paragraph.</p>

The lang attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the
web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers

The following example specifies English as the language

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = “en” >
<body>
. . .
</body>
</html>

The title attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element

<p title = “I’m a tooltip”> This is a paragraph. </p>

Quote attribute values
The html standard doesn’t require quotes around attribute values

Single or Double quotes:
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in html, but single quotes can also be
used. In some situations when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is neccarry to use
single quotes

Larger headings::
Each html heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the
style attribute, using the css font-size property:

<h1 style = “font - size: 60 px;” > heading 1 </h1>

HTML tag reference

<html> defines the root of an html document
<body> defines the documents Boyce
<h1> to <h6> defines HTML headings

HTML paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space ( a

margin) before and after a paragraph

<p> this is a paragraph. </p>
<p> this is another paragraph. </p>

The extra spaces or lines in a html page will not self correct, it varies on your windows size with the
actual compiler, however the actual compiler will not change my display with the extra spaces or
extra lines

HTML horizontal rules::
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an html page and is most often displayed as a horizontal
rule

The <hr> element is used to separate constant (or define a change) in an HTML page

The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag

Code code code
<p> this is some other text. </p>
<hr>

Solution - the HTML <pre> element
The html <pre> element defines pre formatted text
The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually courier), and it preserves
both spaces and line breaks

<p> the pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks: </p>

<pre>
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
Blah blah

Blah blah
</pre>
//this will keep both spaces and line breaks

<p> defines a paragraph
<hr> defines a thematic change in the content with a horizontal line
<br> inserts a single line break
<pre> defines a pre formatted text

The HTML style attribute
Setting the styl of an html element can be done with the style attribute
The html style attribute has the following syntax:

<tag name style = “property:value;”>
The property is a css property and the value is a css value

The CSS background color property defines the background color for an html element

Text color
The CSS color property defines the text color for an html element

FONTS
The CSS font family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element

Text Size
The CSS font size property defines the text size for an html element

Text alignment

<h1 style = “text-align:center;”> entered heading </h1>

HTML formatting elements
<b> - bold text
<strong> - important text
<i> - italic text
<em> - emphasized text
<mark> - marked text
<small> - smaller text
<del> - deleted text
<ins> - inserted text
<sub> - subscript text
<sup> - superscript text

Uhhh in html both <b> and <strong> have the same purpose to display text in bold

HTML <i> and <em> elements :: the HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or
mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic
TIP: the <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a
thought, a ship name, etc

The html <‘em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
TIP: a screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis using verbal stress

HTML text formatting elements::

<b> defines bold text
<em> defines emphasized text
<i> defines a part of text in an alternative voice or mode
<small> defines smaller text
<strong> defines important text
<sub> defines sub scripted text
<sup> defines superscipted text
<ins> defines inserted text
<del> defines deleted text
