The HTML <picture> element allows you to display different pictures for different devices or screen
sizes

The HTML <picture> Element
The HTML <picture> element gives web developers more flexibility in specifying image resources
The <picture> element contains one or more <source> elements, each referring to different images
through the srcset attribute. This way the browser can choose the image that best fits the current
view and/or device
Each <source> element has a media attribute that defines when the image is the most suitable

<picture>
<source media = “(min-width: 650px)” srcset = “img_food.jpg”>
<sourc media = “(min-width: 465px)” srcset=“img_car.jpg”>
<img src = “img_girl.jpg”>
</picture>

The <img> should be the last child element of the <picture> element because the <img> tag is used
by browsers that do not support the <picture> element or if none of the <source> tags match

1. Bandwidth::
If you have a small screen or device, it is not neccarry to load a large image file. The browser will
use the <source> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any of the following elements
1. Formal support::
some browsers or devices may not support all image formats. By using the <picture> element, you
can add images of all formats, and the browser will use the first format it recognizes, and ignore any
of the following elements

The browser will use the first <soucre> element with matching attribute values, and ignore any
following <source> elements

<img> defines an image
<map> defines an image map
<area> defines a clickable area inside an image map
<picture> defines a container for multiple image resources
