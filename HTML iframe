An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page

The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame

An inline frame is used to embed another document wihtin the current HTML document

<iframe src = “url” title = “description” > </iframe>

Tip: it is a good practice to always include a title attribute for the <iframe> this is used by screen
readers to read out what the content of the iframe is

Iframe - set height and width
Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe.
The height and width are specified in pixels by default:

<iframe src = “demo_iframe.htm” height = “200” width = “400” title = “iframe example” > < /iframe>

Or you can add the style attribute and use the CSS height and width properties

Iframe - remove the border
By default, an iframe has a border around it
To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property
<iframe src = “demo_iframe.htm” style = “border:none;” title = “Iframe Example”></iframe>

With css you can also add the change of the size and style

Iframe - target for a link
An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link
The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe

<iframe src = “demo.htm” name = “iframe_a” title = “iframe ex”></iframe>
<p><a href = “https://www.w3schools.com” target = “iframe_a” > w3school.com </a> </p>

The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame
The src attribute defines the URL of the page to embed
Always include a title attribute (for screen readers)
The height and width attributes specifies the size of the iframe
Use border:none; to remove the border around the iframe

<iframe> defines an inline frame
