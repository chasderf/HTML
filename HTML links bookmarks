Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long
To create a bookmark, first create the bookmark, then add a link to it
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark

First use the id attribute to create a bookmark
<hr id = “C4”> Chapter 4 </h2>

Then add a link to the bookmark (“Jump to chapter 4”) from the same page
<a href = “#C4”> Jump to Chapter 4 </a>

You can also add a link to a bookmark to another page
<a href = “html_demo.html#C4”> Jump to Chapter 4 </a>

Use the id attribute (id = “value”) to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href = “#value”) to link to the bookmark
