The HTML <map> tag defines an image map. An image map is an image with clickable areas. The
areas are defined with one or more <area> tags

The image::

The image is inserted using the <img> tag. The only difference from other images is that you must
add a use map attribute

<img src = “workplace.jpg” alt = “workplace” use map = “#workmap”>

The use map value starts with a “#” followed by the name of the image map, and is used to create a
relationship between the image and the image map

Create image Map
Then add a <map> element
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the
required name attribute:
<map name = “workmap”>

The name attribute must have the same value as the <img> s use map attribute

The areas
Then add the clickable areas
a clickable area becomes defined using an <area> element

Shape::
You must define the shape of the clickable area and you can choose these parameters::
Rect- defines a rectuabngular region
Circle - defines a circular region
Poly - defines a polygonal region
Default - defines the entire region

You must also define some coordinates to be able to place the clickable area onto the image

Shape. = “rect”
The coordinates for shape = “rect” come in Paris, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis

So the coordinates 34, 44 is located 34 pixels format he left margin and 44 pixels from the top

<area shape =“rect” coords = “34, 44, 270, 350” href = “computer.htm”>

Image map and JavaScript
A clickable area can also trigger a JavaScript function

Add a click event to the <area> element to execute a JavaScript function

Use the HTML <map> element to define an image map
Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image map
Use th eHTML use map attribute of the <img> element to point to an image map
