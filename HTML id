The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element

You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document

Using the id attribute
The id attribute specifies a unique value for an html element

The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by
JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.

The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name, then define the CSS
properties wihtin curly braces { }

In the follwoing example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name “myheader” . This
<h1> element will be styled according to the #myheader style defintion in the head section

Sooooooo

<style>
#myheader {
Background - color: lightblue;
Color: black;

Padding: 40px;
Text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id = “myHeader”>My header</h1>

</body>
</html>

The ID name is case sensitive

The id name must contain at least one character; cannot start with a number; and must not contain
white spaces (spaces, tabs, etc.)

Difference between class and ID
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elemnts, while an id name must only be used by one
HTML element within the page

HTML bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage
Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long
To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it
Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark

FIRST, we create a bookmark with the id attribute

<h2 id = “C4”> Chapter 4 </h2>

Then add a link to the bookmark (“jump to chapter 4”), from within the same page:

<a href = “#C4”> Jump to chapter 4 </a>

or add a link to the bookmark (“jump to chapter 4 “ ) from another page:

<a href = “html_demo.html#C4”> Jump to chapter 4 </a>
