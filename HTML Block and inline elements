Every HTMNL element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is

There are two display values : block and inline

Block - level elemnts

A block level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space
(a margin) before and after the element

A block level element always takes up the full width availaibale (stretches out to the left and right as
far as it can)

Two commonly used block elements are <p> and <div>
The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HMTL document
The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document

Here are the block level elements in html

<address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd>. <div>. <dl>.
<dt>. <field set>. <figcaption>. <figure>. <foooter>. <form>. <h1>-<h6>. <header>.
<hr>. <li>. <main>. <nav>. <no script>. <ol>. <p>. <pre>. <section>. <table>.
<tfoot>. <ul>. <video>

Inline elements

An inline element doesn’t start on a new line

An inline element only takes up as much width as neccarry

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph

<p> this is an inline span <span style = “border: 1px solid black “ > hello world </span> element
inside a paragraph </p>
<span>Hello World</span>

Here are some inline elements in HTML
<a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big>. <br>. <button>.
<cite>. <code>. <dfn>. <em>. <i>. <img>. <input>. <kbd>. <label>. <map>.
<object>. <output>. <q>. <samp>. <script>. <select>. <small>. <span>.

<strong>. <sub>. <sup>. <textarea> <time>. <tt>. <var>

Note: an inline element cannot contain a block - level element

The <div> element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common
When used together with CSS the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content

The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common
When used together the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text

<p> my mother has <span style = “color:blue;font-weight:bold;”>blue</span> eyes and my father
has <span style = “color:darkolivgreen; font-weight:bold;”> dark green </span> eyes. </p>
