CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However in this
tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you
to try it yourself

Inline CSS::
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element
The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p>
element to red
<h1 style = “color:blue;” > a blue heading </h1>
<p style = “color:red;” > a red paragraph </p>

Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page
An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element
The following example sets the text color of all the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue and the text
color of ALL the <p> element to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a “powder blue”
background color:
<!DOCTYPE>
<html>
<head>
<style>
Body {background - color: powder blue; }
H1 {color: blue; }
P {color:red; }
</style>
</head>

<body>

<h1> this is a heading </h1>
<p> this is a paragraph </p>
</body>
</html>

External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page
<!DOCTYPES html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel = “style sheet” href = “style.css”>
</head>
<body>
<h1> this is a heading </h1>
<p> this is a paragraph </p>
</body>
</html>

The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code
and must be saved with a .css extension
Here is what the “styles.css” file looks like
“Styles.css”
Body {
Background color : powder blue;
}
h1 {
Color: blue }
P { color: red }

CSS colors, fonts, and sizes
Here we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them

later
The css color property defines the text color to be used
The CSS font family property defines the font to be used
The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used

<!DOCTYPES html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
H1 {
Color :blue;
Font - family: verdana;
Font - size: 300%;
}
p {
Color: red
Font - family: courier;
Font - size: 300%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1> this is a heading </h1>
<p> this is a paragraph </p>
</body>
</html>

CSS border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element
Tip you can define a border for nearly all HTML elements
Use of CSS border property
P {
Border: 2px solid powder blue;
}

CSS padding
The CSS padding property defines a paddding (space) between the text and the border
P {
Border: 2px solid powder blue;
Padding: 30px;
}

CSS margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border

p {
border: 2px solid powder blue;
Margin:50 px;
}

Link to external CSS
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web
page
<link rel = “style sheet” href = “https://www.w3sschools.com/html/styles.css”>

<link rel = “style sheet” href = “/html/styles.css”>
